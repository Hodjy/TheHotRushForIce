# TheHotRushForIce

An old game prototype i created in Unity years before i started college.
Sadly i was inexperienced, didnt use source control and lost the source files. (I got a very good lesson about the importance of source control)

After downloading the game, run the executable, and set your prefered settings.

Keybinds:
A-Left
D-Right
E-Start\Respawn
Esc-Open Menu

All assets and code was done by me.
Music by my brother.

My idea for the game was to make the game music half dynamic, and tailored to the characters location. in order to make engaging experience.
