## About the game
An old game prototype i created in Unity years before i started college.  
Sadly i was inexperienced, didnt use source control and lost the source files. (I got a very good lesson about the importance of source control)  

My idea for the game was to make the game music dynamic to his speed, and tailored to the characters location. in order to make engaging experience.  
For this level, i wanted the player to learn by failing rather than a tutorial, therefore most of the hostile obstacles where properly placed on the first lane in order to give the player a less frustrating experience for his first encounter with them in cause he will fail.

## Instructions
After downloading the game, run the executable, and set your prefered settings.  

Keybinds:  
A-Left  
D-Right

All assets and code was done by me.  
A spline plugin was used for the rail like movement.
